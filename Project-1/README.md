# My First README.md
## Jacelyn Henderson
## My Experience:

 My first ever README has been difficult. I felt there were so many tools and outlets to how to understand the assignment that I wasn't sure just where to get started. After exploring all of my resources and finishing the GitHub tutorial/readings, I felt **so silly** for even struggling with the assignment! It was clean cut and percisley enough information to figure out how to get to this point in Project #1.

 I am now getting more and more excited for the course because I know that this information will be applicable to a professional job, but also is *critical* in creating a competitive advantage in job interviews.

Three points for this semester to improve on:
- understand web design thoroughly
- be able to deign a simple website easily
- be able to identify problems in posting websites to web

This will improve my:
1. Web design skills
2. My understanding of web overall
3. How I can benefit companies through desining websites

Snooping:
 I am excited to also study how the Wayback Machine can be used to find styles, tips, and designs in creating web sites. I enjoyed analyzing the Apples differences from when Wayback Machine first had a screenshot in Dec. 12, 1996 till now. The website has less words on the screen, larger and more vibrant pictures, and more links to other products/options. Whereas the 1996 screenshot displayed plenty of paragraphs, little to no pictures, and didn't fit to the screen.
 I also loved seeing how the my.umt.edu website has developed over the years. From April of 2013 to now it has changed quite alot. They have added more appealing icons and less ussless information. Lastly, I enjoyed looking at the style of nike. They're all white screen with black letters and decals popped off the screen and each page was simple.
