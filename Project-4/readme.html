  <h4><strong>Starting Out</strong></h4>
  <p>
    I started this week reading through the Media-Ed-Online site and watching the videos. This has also reminded me of how different moodle is on my phone verses on my desktop. I think this weeks project will be very important way to finish up this semester. </p>

  <h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
  <p>
    I chose to put into the website simple content that covered:
<ul>
<li>1. Introduction to what RWD is.</li>
<li>2. Why RWD is important to use in Web Design</li>
<li>3. How to implement this process into web design</li>
<li>For the title, I chose brighter colors and centered this content at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Implement the important conetent we learned this week from the Media-Wed-Dev intro.</li>
</ul>

  <h6><strong>Finish</strong><h6>
    <p> I'm so excited to have completed this course. It hasn't been an easy one, too say the least, but it was very interesting! It opened my eyes to a completely different world and showed how important all the little details are in creating a website. This class gave me such an appreciation for web developers, designers, and anyone who studies the ever changing technology world. I'm happy to say I've learned a lot in Intro to Web Design.
