    I have started to actually create a website that I am dreaming up in my own head. I had no clue that Google provided so many different fonts and ways to download them to a folder so they're able to be accessable on Atom. I'm going to make my website with alot of cursive, handwriting fonts and pastel colors to give a relaxed and soft vibe. I also want to include pictures that are commonly related to happiness.</p>

  <p>  I used the site <link href='https://www.palleton.com' rel="stylesheet"> to create my color scheme and hand picked each color based on what I felt represented happiness.</p>
  <p><strong>Colors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Background - #FFDD39</li>
<li>Navigation - #FF7400</li>
<li>Pallet - #</li>
<li>Padding - #ffffff</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Dancing Script</li>
<li>Euphoria Script</li>
<li>Norican</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>I struggled getting the look I truly invisioned but I liked the orange and yellow color scheme I chose for happiness. I'm also hoping to find a better look for the in text/paragraph fonts because I feel they clash.</p>
<p>I've found this week to be adding onto all of the material we've learned as well as adding into the creativity concepts in web design. I'm trying to become even stronger in my web development because I know I will need it for project 4.</p>
