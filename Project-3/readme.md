    I have started to actually create a website that I am dreaming up in my own head. I had no clue that Google provided so many different fonts and ways to download them to a folder so they're able to be accessable on Atom. I'm going to make my website with alot of cursive, handwriting fonts and pastel colors to give a relaxed and soft vibe. I also want to include pictures that are commonly related to happiness.</p>

  <p>  I used the site <link href='https://www.palleton.com' rel="stylesheet"> to create my color scheme and hand picked each color based on what I felt represented happiness.</p>
