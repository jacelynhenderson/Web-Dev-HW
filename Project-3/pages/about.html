<h3> Article: The Perfectionist </h3>
<div class="paragraph2">
<p> Within the blog is a specific article titled, "The Perfectionist". It describes how people aspire for success and often let the need to succeed overwhelm us. I decided to share this article with my mother because she has been through a lot of stress the past 5 years in her career because of seeking perfection in every area of life. Her and I have talked about how this can be unhealthy and that it effects her happiness. In this article, Gary Van Warmerdam breaks down why we may need to have perfection and how to help change our thought process about success to become overall more happy. The Perfectionist article also described how working with perfectionists can be exhausting and to remember that, "The next time your Judge and Perfectionist want to give you a hard time for failing to meet their standards. Consider that they are failing you. They are failing to notice that their imaginary world doesnâ€™t map to the real world."
