#My second README
##Jacelyn Henderson
###My experience:


  I AM FRUSTRATED!! I think this is such a useful tool that I want to be able to
  utilize in my future profession, but I am seriously struggling keeping up with
  adding details. I feel confident in the overall code I am writing, but I want to
  be able to feel more creative with the process of designing a web page. This
  second project has been a longer process adding details and I'm sure that is how
  the course is structured so people are challenged. I do enjoy the addition of
  learning how to insert images, internal, and external links. I need to still
  add my submission link/box to my instructions forum.

  This is my second README document and I'm still getting a hang of how to decipher all I should be including in each document. I'm confident I will figure this class out but I'm wishing I had the prerequisite course done for this class so I would feel less of a newbie.
